This is a sample application demonstrating Spring 5 Webflux framework with endpoints written in a functional style as opposed to an annotation based style demonstrated http://github.com/bijukunjummen/sample-webflux-annot-cassandra[here].
It uses Spring Data Cassandra's support for reactive libraries to provide an end to end reactive flow.

A blog post accompanying this sample is http://www.java-allandsundry.com/2017/04/spring-web-flux-functional-style-with.html[here]

= Install a local Cassandra

The simplest way to install Cassandra is via the excellent https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm[ccm] tool.

If you are using a Mac-OSX, you may have to add more loopback interfaces this way:

[source, bash]
----
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3 up
----

And bring up a 3 node Cassandra 3.9 based cluster:

[source, bash]
----
ccm create test -v 3.9 -n 3 -s --vnodes
----


Connect to one of the nodes:

[source, bash]
----
ccm node1 cqlsh
----

And run these cql statements

[source, sql]
----

CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS sample WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1};

use sample;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  sample.hotels (
    id UUID,
    name varchar,
    address varchar,
    state varchar,
    zip varchar,
    primary key(id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  sample.hotels_by_letter (
    first_letter varchar,
    hotel_name varchar,
    hotel_id UUID,
    address varchar,
    state varchar,
    zip varchar,
    primary key((first_letter), hotel_name, hotel_id)
);


CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sample.hotels_by_state AS
SELECT id, name, address, state, zip FROM hotels
WHERE state IS NOT NULL AND id IS NOT NULL AND name IS NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY ((state), id)
WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (name DESC);
----

= Run the App

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew clean bootRun
----

= Populate Data

Assuming that https://httpie.org/[httpie] is installed in your machine

[source, bash]
----
http POST 'http://localhost:8080/hotels' state="WA" name="A Sample Hotel" zip="00001" address="Address 1"
http POST 'http://localhost:8080/hotels' state="WA" name="B Sample Hotel" zip="00002" address="Address 2"
http POST 'http://localhost:8080/hotels' state="OR" name="C Sample Hotel" zip="00003" address="Address 3"
----

OR with CURL

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/hotels" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "name": "A Sample Hotel",
  "address": "Address 1",
  "state": "WA",
  "zip": "00001"
}'

curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/hotels" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "name": "B Sample Hotel",
  "address": "Address 2",
  "state": "WA",
  "zip": "00002"
}'

curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/hotels" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "name": "C Sample Hotel",
  "address": "Address 3",
  "state": "OR",
  "zip": "10001"
}'
----

= Query Data

Get hotels with names starting with "A" - internally makes use of a table with duplicated content,
maintained with first letter as the partition key

[source, bash]
----
http GET 'http://localhost:8080/hotels/startingwith/A'
----

OR with Curl

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8080/hotels/startingwith/A" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
----

Get Hotels from State - makes use of a materialized view
[source, bash]
----
http GET 'http://localhost:8080/hotels/fromstate/OR'
----

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8080/hotels/fromstate/OR" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
----


= Delete Data

Delete Hotels by id

[source, bash]
----
http DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/hotels/<id>'
----

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "DELETE" "http://localhost:8080/hotels/<id>" -H "Accept: application/json"
----
